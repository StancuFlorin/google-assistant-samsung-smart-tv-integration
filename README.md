# Old TVs

If you have an older TV (<2016) that are not using websockets, you will need to use the [old version](https://github.com/StancuFlorin/google-assistant-samsung-smart-tv-integration/tree/version-2) of the script written in Python2 and using [samsungctl](https://github.com/Ape/samsungctl) for [legacy support](https://github.com/StancuFlorin/google-assistant-samsung-smart-tv-integration/blob/version-2/config.ini).

## Requirements ##

- Python 3.6 or later 
- `# pip install -r requirements.txt`

## Installation ##

### CloudAMQP ###
- Create a free account on [CloudAMQP](https://www.cloudamqp.com).
- Create a new instance. The free plan is enough.
- Go to the RabbitMQ Manager.
- Add a new ``exchange``:
	- name: ``google.home.assistant``
	- type: ``direct``
- Add a new ``queue``:
	- name: ``samsung.smart.tv``
	- arguments: ``Message TTL`` with the value of ``30000``. The name of this feature is ``x-message-ttl``
- Go back to the exchange that you created and add a binding to the queue:
	- name: ``samsung.smart.tv``
	- routing key: ``samsung.smart.tv``

### Locally ###

- Check the ``config.ini`` file and add your own details there.
- To enable to comunication with your TV you will need to put the correct IP on ``SamsungSmartTV.host``. Your TV should be on the same network with the PC that will run this script.
- The CloudAMQP information also needs to be added. Make sure that you add the correct data there.
- Run the script using ``python samsung-smart-tv-remote.py`` or ``./samsung-smart-tv-remote.py``

### IFTTT ###

- Create a new applet on [IFTTT](https://ifttt.com).
- On ``this`` select ``Google Assistant`` and ``Say a simple phrase`` from there.
- Add a phrase. Use only lower case letters (ex: change the channel on hbo).
- On ``that`` select ``Maker Webhooks`` and ``Make a web request`` from there.
- On URL add ``https://pspeaemf:ByOti2ToHWya_dV79B85GaDZaORBpi3L@lark.rmq.cloudamqp.com/api/exchanges/pspeaemf/google.home.assistant/publish``. Change the username, password and the RabbitMQ host with your own.
- Select ``POST`` method and ``application/json`` as content type.
- On body add  
	```
	{
		"properties":{
		  "content-type":"application/json"
		},
		"routing_key":"samsung.smart.tv",
		"payload":"{\"command\": \"CHANGE_CHANNEL\", \"value\": \"135\"}",
		"payload_encoding":"string"
	}
	```
	- In the above example, ``135`` is the channel number for HBO. You can add different applets like this for whatever channel you want and the only thing that you need to change is the the ``value`` node.  
	- You can also use custom commands like ``turn off the tv``, but you need to change the ``command`` node like in this example:
	```
	{
		"properties":{
		  "content-type":"application/json"
		},
		"routing_key":"samsung.smart.tv",
		"payload":"{\"command\": \"TURN_OFF\"}",
		"payload_encoding":"string"
	}
	```

## Custom Commands ##

Here is the list of the custom commands implemented so far:

Command Code | Command Description
------------ | -------
TURN_OFF | Turn off the TV

## Make the script start at startup ##

If you use a Raspberry Pi to run this script you may want to make it start each time you boot your device. There are several ways how to do it. Here is one.

``# nano /etc/rc.local``

Before ``exit 0`` put the below line. This will start the script 15 seconds after the device is up.

``/bin/sleep 15 && cd /path/to/your/script && python samsung-smart-tv-remote.py &``

``# reboot``

## Tested Devices ##
